# Robotics_Assignment_2
Group project- a smart robot that can make decisions using pre-set beliefs 

<h3> About </h3>

<p> This was a university assignment for 3 people. The purpose of this assignment was to create a JASON file that would consist of all the 
beliefs that we wanted the robot to have when faced with a decision (these were specified). The robot had to accurately identify its 
position and remember what location it had to return to. It was set to be in a grid that had coloured squares. Each square represented
the patient or the hospital. The robot had to find the critical patient and take them to the hospital as well as find the non-critical.
However, if the non-critical were found first then the robot had to remember the location of that patient and return there when the 
critical patient has been taken to the hospital. The robot had to find all the patients and take them to the hospital after which its 
mission was complete.</p>

<p> This project was a collaboration with my peers which involved all of us working on majority of the elements together especially 
designing the logic for the actions as well as locating the robot in provided space as well as making sure that it completed its 
mission in the shortest time possible. </p>
